- If you want to create an abstract class which only has abstract methods, then you can create an interface at that time.
- An interface contains only public abstract methods.
- Can not create an object of interface directly.
- You can implement a class which implements that interface.
- All the variables in Interface are by default final and static.
- A Class can implements one or more than one interface.
- Interface to interface relationship is called extends
